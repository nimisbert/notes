The left-hand limit is defined as:
$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow a^{-}} f(x) = L
$$
The left-hand limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ (or the limit of $f(x)$) as $x$ approaches $a$ from the left) is equal to $L$ if we can make the values of $f(x)$ arbitrarily close to $L$ by taking $x$ to be sufficiently close to $a$ and $x$ less than $a$.

For the right-hand limit:
$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow a^{+}} f(x) = L
$$
