Let $f$ be a function defined on both sides of $a$, except possibly at $a$ itself. Then:
$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow a} f(x)=+\infty
$$
means that the values of $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily large (as large as we please) by taking $x$ sufficiently close to $a$, but not equal to $a$.

Let $f$ be a function defined on both sides of $a$, except possibly at $a$ itself. Then:
$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow a} f(x) = - \infty
$$
means that the values of $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily large negative by taking $x$ sufficiently close to $a$, but not equal to $a$.
