Suppose $f(x)$ is defined when $x$ is near the number $a$. $f$ is defined on an open interval that contains $a$, except possibly $a$ itself. Then we write:
$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow a} f(x) = L
$$
Meaning "the limit of $f(x)$, as $x$ approaches $a$, equals $L$". By calculating a limit we __never__ consider that $x=a$.

Using [[One-Sided Limit]] we give a more precise definition of the limit:
$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow a} = L 
$$
if and only if:
$$
\begin{align}
\lim_{x\rightarrow a^-} f(x) = L \\
\lim_{x\rightarrow a^+} f(x) = L
\end{align}
$$
